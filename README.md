some scripts about describing the way on learning Pascal language  
I wondered someday i could write the code which could do some boring things such as typing numbers in many many cells , after a long time, i
never make up minds.
but now, i must pick up the ability of reading and writting in English. It has been ten years after the last time i wrote some articles in english.
Maybe there are so many grammar mistakes and wrong sentences, please be generous on a person who dont use it for ten years.
i know clearly many will suggest me learning python or other languages,but actually,it's so difficult. 
Actually,for my four years in university time, i read lots of chinese ancient characters, i majored in chinese,so no math and programming 
in my courses.
Anyway, this is my first step,but definitely not the last step.
Losts of CHINGLISH. Sorry for that but thanx for you who are asdie me.
